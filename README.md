## Fast local setup

You can set up this project on your local network by using these easy steps:

- Clone this repo on your pc;
- Create virtual environment with ```virtualenv venv```, activate it and install dependencies with ```pip install -r requirements.txt```;
- At the top of ```project/settings.py``` set ```EASY_RUN_MODE``` from ```False``` to ```True```;
- Run ```python manage.py makemigrations``` and ```python manage.py migrate```;
- Start server by ```python manage.py runserver``` or ```python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:7777``` to open it to local network (for example, over wifi).

It will run faster locally than on actual website because of multi-threading (website is on virtual single-core cpu), file uploading time and actual distance to the server (ping).
